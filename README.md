# Courses Viewer
An html website using the [courses API](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/coursesAPI) to display all the available courses given at the University Of Applied Science Potsdam. This project was used as a demonstration of an API usage with ajax loading.

## Getting started
Clone the repository locally and move into it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/coursesViewer.git && cd coursesViewer
```
And open the file `src/index.html` in your favourite browser.

# Motivation
This project has been made as project of the 2 weeks long Workshop "Creating an open sourced REST API" given by Julia Freyhoff @antsteelmule and Lucas Vogel @vogelino in the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam.

This project was done in parallel with two other projects:
- :octocat: [Data Scraper](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/fhpCoursesScraper)
A webscraper extracting information about the courses of the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam to fill the MongoDB database.
- :octocat: [Courses API](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/coursesAPI)
A REST API designed to create, read, update and delete study courses (CRUD).

If you want to know more about the Project and/or the Workshop, look at our [documentation](https://fhp.incom.org/projekt/7668) (german), or get in touch with us.
